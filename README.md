# OpenCV Image Processing
> Code from Summer REU 2019

During the summer of 2019, I had the opportunity to work at Georgia State University, with funding from the NSF, as a REU intern. My work was using the python library OpenCV to remove dust from solar images. The task was more than a simple image processing problem as the dust particles on the image would move around and require image object tracking techniques to remove. 

With these Python files I was able to come up with reasonable accuracy with removing these dust specs, though future work is needed on the project. 

## Getting started

Check out the EXAMPLE_HERE file for how I was using the initial files for the research project. You'll need a few preinstalled libraries. 

```
matplotlib
numpy 
opencv
```

### Initial Configuration

You'll need access to the Georgia State University DMLabs servers for access to the photos

## Features

This project is designed to 
* Track different objects across the surface of solar images 
* Classify whether those objects are dust specs on a camera lens or sun spots 

## Contributing

As always, pull requests are welcome. If you would like to fork the repository, please use a feature branch. 
If you have any questions, please feel free to message me.
